  Concluding remarks:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We presented a variational framework for phase-field modeling of fracture in general dissipative solids.
    \item Careful constitutive choices result in favorable responses:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item unperturbed elastoplastic response;
            \item regularization-length independent critical fracture strength;
            \item regularization-length independent crack resistance curve.
          \end{itemize}
    \item We introduced a novel coalescence dissipation as an alternative way of coupling fracture and plasticity.
    \item The model starts to look really predictive in several challenging problems.
    \item The flexibility of the framework is demonstrated by modeling oxide spallation in HTHXs.
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item All numerical results are obtained using RACCOON (a MOOSE-based application). It is open-source and massively parallel. All models are plug-n-play.
    \item Poster session at 5:45 - 7:00 pm, July 28th. Title: ``A Variational Framework for Phase-Field Modeling of Fracture in General Dissipative Solids''.
